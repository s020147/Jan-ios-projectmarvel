# Marvel Project Challenge

Welcome to the Marvel Project challenge. You will be using https://developer.marvel.com/ as the data source for this challenge.
This assessment is meant to simulate real world work where you are fixing and improving an existing codebase.

## Instructions

**Fix all bugs and improve the app in any way you see fit.** Describe changes you make in commit messages.


## Requirements

- Must compile and run
- Use MVVM pattern
- Minimize third-party libraries use - document reasoning if you need to use one
- Do not upload this code to a public repository (e.g. GitHub)
- Okay to use AI to assist, but document use (see questions)


## Questions

1. How did you use AI to complete this project?
2. List any code you did not directly implement: snippets from past projects, links to resources Stack Overflow, AI chat transcripts, dependencies, etc.
3. What portion of the code do you feel is most important for us to review more closely? Example: The overall UI/UX - I really liked how...
4. If you were to continue to develop the project, what would you add, change, or improve?
5. Anything else you want us to know while we review your project?


## Project Submission

Once completed, email us a zipped version of the project. Include a file with answers to the questions above.

GOOD LUCK!
